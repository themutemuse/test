"The Confundus Charm is a particularly powerful charm that leaves anything confused forgetful and impressionable often causing people to wander off absent-mindedly. If the target is an object that operates or functions on its own it will operate erratically malfunction or completely shut down. This spell has no effect on a completely inanimate objects that entirely depend on external manipulation.","If the target is a creature you choose within range it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can’t take reactions and if not distracted with something you roll a d10. If you roll 1-8 the creature must use all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction assign a direction to each number 1-8. If you roll a 9-10 the creature doesn't move. Whether it moves or not the creature doesn’t take an action this turn.","If desired you can suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) at the time of casting and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to directly hurt itself or its allies will have no effect. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example you might suggest that a wizard hug the next blast-ended skrewt he sees. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires the activity isn’t performed.","At the end of each of its turns an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds the spell's effects end for that target.","At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them."
