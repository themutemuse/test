"A magical aura makes your impact on your surroundings unseen masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and canâ€™t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage."
